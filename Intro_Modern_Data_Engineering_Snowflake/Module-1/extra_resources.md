I recommend the following resources to learn even more about batch ingestion with Snowflake:
    • Overview of data loading | Snowflake Documentation – Unless you're interested, feel free to skip any sections that refer to continuous or streaming data loading.
    • Data loading considerations | Snowflake Documentation – I recommend reading all of the topics within this "Considerations" section. Feel free to skip any sections that refer to continuous or streaming data loading.
    • Snowflake Batch Data Loading | Best Practices in 2024  – Outside of Snowflake's official documentation, I highly recommend this resource.
    • Deep dive into the internals of Snowflake Virtual Warehouses | by Samartha Chandrashekar – An incredible, technical deep dive on Snowflake's compute resources: virtual warehouses. Highly recommended. This resource will really level you up.
    • Summary of data loading features | Snowflake Documentation – Technical reference of the supported features for using the COPY INTO command. Handy information that you should keep in mind when using this command.
